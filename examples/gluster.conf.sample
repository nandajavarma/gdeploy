#------------------------------

# Generic section [devices] is applicable to all the hosts listed in the [hosts]
# section. However, if sections of hosts [hostname] or [ip-address] is present,
# then the data in generic sections like [devices] are ignored. Host specific
# data take precedence.

# [devices]
# /dev/sda
# /dev/vdb
# /dev/vda
#------------------------------

# Section [disktype] specifies which disk configuration is used while
# setting up the backend. Supports RAID 10, RAID 6 and JBOD configurations.
# If this field is left empty, it will be by default taken as JBOD.
# This is common for all the hosts.

# [disktype]
# raid6
#------------------------------

# Section [diskcount] specifies the number of data disks in the setup. This is a
# mandatory field if the disk configuration specified is either RAID 10 or
# RAID 6 and will be ignored if architecture is JBOD. This is host specific
# data.

# [diskcount]
# 10
#------------------------------

# Section [stripesize] specifies the stripe_unit size in KB. This is a mandatory
# field if disk configuration is RAID 6. If this is not specified in case of
# RAID 10 configurations, it will take the default value 256K. This field is
# not necessary for JBOD configuration of disks. Do not add any suffixes like
# K, KB, M, etc.This is host specific data.

# [stripesize]
# 128
#------------------------------

# vg names for the above devices
# The number of vgs in the [vgs] should match the devices

# [vgs]
# CUSTOM_vg
#------------------------------

# pool names for the above volume groups
# The number of pools listed in the [pools] section should match the number of
# vgs.

# [pools]
# CUSTOM_pool
#------------------------------

# lv names for the above volume groups
# The number of logical volumes listed in the [lvs] section should match the
# number of vgs.

# [lvs]
# CUSTOM_lv
#-------------------------------

# Brick mountpoints for the logical volumes
# The number of mountpoints should match the number of logical volumes listed
# above.
# IMP: If only gluster deployement is to be done and not back-end setup, just
# give this data about the hosts specified in the [hosts] section along
# with the client data.

# Specifies the client hosts and mountpoints to mount the gluster

#-----------------------------------

# The section volume specifies the configuration options for the volume.

# 'volname' option specifies the volume name. Default is glustervol

# 'transport' option specifies the transport type. Default is tcp. Options are
# tcp or rdma or tcp,rdma

# 'replica' option will specify if the volume should be of type replica or not.
# options are yes and no. Default is no.
# If 'replica' is given as yes, 'replica_count' should be given.
# Option 'arbiter_count' is optional.

# 'disperse' option will specify if the volume should be of type disperse.
# options are yes and no. Default is no.
# 'disperse_count' is optional even if the 'disperse' is yes. if not specified,
# the number of bricks specified in the command line is taken as the
# disperse_count value.
# If 'redundancy_count' is not specified, and if 'disperse' is yes,  it's
# default value is computed so that it generates an optimal configuration.
